## About Me

My name is Spyros Seimenis and I am a well-rounded computer **security engineer and researcher** that specializes 
in finding and reporting bugs through reverse engineering and source code auditing. I have worked
with numerous clients worldwide in various fields like mobile device platforms, IoT and banking and
helped them secure their products. Having a software engineering background, I also provide consultation 
on best coding practices that promote the writing of more secure code.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the Computer Engineering and Informatics department of University of Patras.
My main areas of research interest there were cryptography, programming languages (topics such as compilers, algorithms 
and data structures, parallel processing, software engineering), communication networks, topics on theory of computation 
and computer graphics. I did my thesis on penetration testing methodologies, techniques, processes and reporting, covering 
the technical and business aspects of a penetration test with the final goal of producing a solid and helpful report.
