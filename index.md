## About Me

My name is Spyros Seimenis and I am a software engineer interested in all areas related to security on Linux. Most recently I've been working on improving Ubuntu's platform security where my main areas of work are confidential computing technologies, remote attestation, verified/measured boot and runtime integrity.

In the past I have worked as a security researcher, finding and reporting bugs through reverse engineering and source code auditing. I have worked with numerous clients worldwide in various sectors such as mobile device platforms, IoT and banking and helped them secure their products.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the Computer Engineering and Informatics department of University of Patras. My main areas of research interest there were cryptography, programming languages (topics such as compilers, algorithms and data structures, parallel processing, software engineering), communication networks, topics on theory of computation and computer graphics. I did my thesis on penetration testing methodologies, techniques, processes and reporting, covering the technical and business aspects of a penetration test with the final goal of producing a solid and helpful report.
